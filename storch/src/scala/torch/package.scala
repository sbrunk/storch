/** The torch package contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and defines mathematical operations over
  * these tensors. Additionally, it provides many utilities for efficient serializing of Tensors and arbitrary types,
  * and other useful utilities.
  *
  * It has a CUDA counterpart, that enables you to run your tensor computations on an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability
  * `>= 3.0`
